## Natural Language Processing Algorithm using Python

### Project Description
This university project aimed to understand and explore Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, specifically focusing on keyword extraction algorithms such as TF-IDF, to enhance customer service operations in the digital era. Automating responses and improving the capabilities of chatbots can achieve the goal of streamlining customer service processes, reducing response times, and elevating customer satisfaction. The project employs Python programming and various libraries, including `sklearn`, to implement the TF-IDF model and generate word clouds that analyze AI-generated customer queries.

### Tasks Performed

1. **Generation of AI-Generated Customer Queries**:
   - Develop and use algorithms to generate synthetic customer queries that mimic real-world customer interactions to create a robust dataset for testing.
   - Utilize these generated queries to test the NLP model without the need for real customer data for the purpose of this university project.

2. **Implementation of TF-IDF Model**:
   - Implement the TF-IDF model using Python and the `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer` to calculate TF-IDF scores for terms in customer queries.
   - Analyze the significance of various words or phrases to prioritize customer service responses.

3. **Visualization and Analysis**:
   - Use word clouds to visually present the most frequent terms before and after applying the TF-IDF algorithm, showcasing the effective extraction of key terms.
